# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

## (Java and Python)
This repository contains two implementations of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game: one in Java and the other in Python. Both versions provide a simple graphical user interface (GUI) where players can take turns placing their marks ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 game board. The game checks for winners and ties after each move and displays appropriate messages accordingly.
